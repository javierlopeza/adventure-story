\subsection*{Chapter 3: Javier}

\normalsize How did I get here? Actually it was a long journey. I come from Chile, from the west coast of South America, and for someone like me, leaving the country and studying abroad is really an adventure. I left my family behind, thousands of miles away, and set out on a journey in search of knowledge and new opportunities. This adventure has allowed a character like me to discover new cultures and exceptional people that will mark life forever.
