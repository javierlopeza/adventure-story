\Huge Adventure Story Project

“Shoot!” I curse to myself as I run to turn off the stove. I had accidentally left my brussel sprouts too long on the pan. I return to my kitchen counter, where countless jars of herbs and spices riddle the space, neighboring bowls filled with hot, smoky rub, and sauces that are waiting to be marinated with. Smells muddling into the crisp air; smells of sizzling fresh garlic, searing caramelized brussel sprouts. Pots and pans continue to fill the sink, each once holding its own little creation: five-spice marinated chicken wings, lemongrass and cilantro black rice. \par
This apparent discord is not just spilled bowls of rustic vegetable soup or two too many clouds of flour. It is not cut fingertips and burned palms or the possibility that I might have burned the house down. It is, rather, some sort of harmonious chaos of food. It is the explosion of flavors that the nutty pesto sauce gives to the cucumber and the kick of heat the cayenne gives the rub. It is the sweet aroma of lavender infused sugar and apple pie fresh out of the oven. It is my kitchen. 
It is not like this everyday; most days run smoothly with ingredients coming in and food coming out. But there are still times in which things get out of hand, times in which I fail, and times in which I admittedly experiment too much. \par
My time in the kitchen has taught me the fragility of cooking, how one more teaspoon of vanilla could make such a huge difference or how fifteen extra seconds on the pan could overcook scallops. It has taught me creativity, that desserts can be savory and that yes, oranges can actually go with chocolate. But more importantly, it has inspired my need for experimentation, my need for something more appetizing, for something more enticing, for something new and exciting. \par
My world inspired me to step out of my small box, in which I had once lived my whole life before, during high school, leading into college. My life became my kitchen. I was able to taste new experiences and devour adventures. These experiences only intensify my thirst something newer and greater that my world inspired. I want to go out and try new things and gain more experience. I want to make mistakes and maybe set of alarms and maybe burn my brussel sprouts from time to time, and I definitely have done both here. I might’ve burnt my house down, but, I think I found something great here at Berkeley I’ll carry through the rest of my life.
