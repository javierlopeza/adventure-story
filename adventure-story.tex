\Huge Adventure Story Project

So, how did we all get here?

Being born in San Jose, the heart of the Silicon Valley, I grew up surrounded by towering tech company headquarters. With technological centers of Apple or Google just a short car ride away, I knew full well  the immense power and reach of computer science. I saw it on every long car. I felt it with awe. In both senses of the word, with all of the wonder, and, especially, all of the fear. Growing up as a low-income student, with parents who neither finished college nor spoke English fluently, I convinced myself that Computer Science was an impossibility. It took me a full 17 years until I got over this misconception and found my first CS mentor and my headway into the guarded walls of Computer Science. It was my senior year of high school, and I became friends with Michael, a junior who was just a Computer Science Genius. Together, we started the Oak Grove Robotics Club. I’ve been obsessed with coding ever since. Coming here to Berkeley and taking CS61A, however, was a completely new experience, and I would say, my first real taste of Computer Science. Though soul-crushing and tear-filled, it was a euphoric experience. I want to pursue that feeling, and apply my newly learned knowledge into something real and tangible, with an actual real world impact. That’s why I want to get into product development in general. I want to join CodeBase specifically because of your mentorship program. I learned from my experiences with Michael and the Robotics Club that Computer Science isn’t something to be learned without guidance. I’m still just now getting over my fear of Stack Overflow and its ever menacing, capital ‘L’ Lingo. I'm excited to learn everything I can from being here at Berkeley.
