\subsection*{Chapter 3: \textit{Javier}}

How did I get here? Actually it was a long journey. I come from Chile, from the west coast of South America, and for someone like me, leaving the country and studying abroad is really an adventure. I left my family behind, thousands of miles away, and set out on a journey in search of knowledge and new opportunities. This adventure has allowed a character like me to discover new cultures and exceptional people that will mark life forever.

It all started a year ago, when I was presented with the opportunity of my life: to go to study at the University of California, Berkeley. It was an opportunity that I decided to take without thinking twice, because I was deciding to go to one of the best universities in the world.

Months after my application, I received the expected letter of acceptance and after that I had to prepare all the details of the trip. The farewell is difficult. Friends, family and many people that I will not see in a long time. I hope to come back and join them to share all my experiences and adventures.

This adventure is just beginning, but for now there have been many experiences that I have faced and will never forget. I have had the good fortune to cross the Golden Gate Bridge by bicycle, while water sports enthusiasts perform kitesurfing and cross the bridge below spectacularly. I have been able to walk the inclined streets of San Francisco and appreciate the multitude of cultures that share in every corner of the city.

I have had to face hunger, cold and fatigue, but there is still a long way to go in this adventure. Great feats and vicissitudes are coming to avoid succumbing to the remoteness of the home. But I am convinced that in the future I will return home and I will be able to tell with great happiness all the stories of my adventures in California.
