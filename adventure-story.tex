\subsection*{Chapter 3: Javier}

How did I get here? Actually it was a long journey. I come from Chile, from the west coast of South America, and for someone like me, leaving the country and studying abroad is really an adventure. I left my family behind, thousands of miles away, and set out on a journey in search of knowledge and new opportunities. This adventure has allowed a character like me to discover new cultures and exceptional people that will mark life forever.

It all started a year ago, when I was presented with the opportunity of my life: to go to study at the University of California, Berkeley. It was an opportunity that I decided to take without thinking twice, because I was deciding to go to one of the best universities in the world.

Meses después de mi postulación, recibí la esperada carta de aceptación y posterior a eso tuve que preparar todos los detalles del viaje. Es difícil la despedida. Los amigos, la familia y muchas personas que no veré en mucho tiempo. Espero poder volver y juntarme con ellos para compartir todas mis experiencias y aventuras.
